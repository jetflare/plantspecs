	<p>Is the presentation order according to the list?</p>
	<p>Is it possible to treat wastewater without knowing what's in it?</p>
	<p>Due to poisoning, the silver catalyst must be replaced. How often?</p>
	<p>Can references be repeated?</p>
	<p>HSE: also talk about plans to manage waste?</p>
	<p>The briefing states: Each individual is required to present 3 relevant pieces of information concerning 3 items under each topic.

		Is it exactly 3 for both items and relevant pieces?</p>
	<p>Does our choice of headings affect our choices later on in the project?</p>
